# ardicsrtcollector_parsing_and_BERT_vector

* Helps to parse sentences in database.
* If file that is in database is not in your
  local directory, it uses ardicsrtcollector module
  and downloads missing url.

* Reads existing google responses from db and
  creates new database with additional bert_vector column.
